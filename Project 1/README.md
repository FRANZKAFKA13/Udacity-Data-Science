# Udacity Data Science Project 1

This repository contains the code I wrote for tackling project 1 in the Data Scientist Nanodegree by Udacity.

## Dataset

In this project I used the [Airbnb Seattle Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). It contains information from 3818 Airbnb listings from Seattle, along with some other information. 

## Questions Answered

I tried to answer the following questions:

**Question 1**<br>
One of the first things to look out for when it comes to real estate is the location. Therefore, I want to know which areas are most expensive and therefore maybe also most lucrative.

**Question 2**<br>
Once the location is set, there might be other things we can optimize to maximize ROI. Maybe there are things on the listing page that we can tweak? Maybe we need to invest in amenities? Therefore, the question is: which factors have the highest impact on prices?

**Question 3**<br>
A friend has an apartment in Seattle downtown that he wants to rent out via Airbnb. It has one big bedroom, a kitchen and one bathroom. Should he invest money to split the bedroom into two rooms?



## Deployment
